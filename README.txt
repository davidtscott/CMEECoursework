Within this CMEECourseWork directory can be found an individual directory for each week of course work undertaken. Each directory is further subdivided into four folders; Code, Data, Results and Sandbox. 

Within the Code directory can be found all code and scripts produced for that week. Each script call's data from the Data directory (../Data) where all data inputs are stored! Finally all output generated are sent and stored in the Results (../Results) directories. 

Each results directory contains a .gitignore file so as to keep the git repository clean. However all results can be regenerated by running the code provided on the data.
